# Portfolio
This is a work in progress. About 50% finished. I want to retain and migrate my decent React site that is currently up to www.dougrosenbergdevarchive.com, and put this up

## Screenshots
The first screen shot shows the kind-of-cool design of the landing page, although the parallax scrolling effect doesn't come through lol.

Second screen shot show an Angular-Material table display of all the technologies I know, with sorting, filtering, and pagination. I also have some basic biographical info there.

The final screen shot shows the Mat-Cards I used to showcase my projects.

## Further development
Until I can successfully host my old site, I'm holding off and focusing on back-end work. Eventually I will add a nice contact form, a few text effects, and some bells and whistles to showcase my moderate front-end chops.
